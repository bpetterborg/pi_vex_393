# pi_vex_393

Control Vex 393 motors with a Raspberry Pi. 

You can use this to replace a Cortex with a Pi. While it is untested, it 
should work with other SOCs that work with RPi.GPIO2. Be sure to set the 
motors correctly. 

Currently this only works with 2 motors at a time but I will
probably fix that in the future.
