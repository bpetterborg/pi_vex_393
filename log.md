# Project log
This is where I will document my progress, thoughts, and ideas for this project. I also be using
this for my Robotics class exam.

## Introduction, and stuff for the exam

##### What language did I study?
Python - I'm not so much studying Python as I am just using it. I'm already familiar with the 
language.

##### What is this used for?
Controlling Vex 393 Motors using a Raspberry Pi. 

##### What topics have I learned about?
- Functional Programming
	- Structuring large projects
	- Modularity
- Preparing modules for the PyPI

##### What Have I Learned
At the risk of sounding controversial, I prefer Functional Programming to OOP (Object-Oriented 
Programming). I feel that it is much more modular, clean and organised. 

#### Ideas
This is where I store ideas for potential solutions to problems with my code

- Store motors/setup values in a ~~dictionary~~ .jsonc file. 
	- You can just use attributes in the .json file instead of having to iterate through
		the number of motors and available setup values.
